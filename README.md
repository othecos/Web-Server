# Web-Server
This is a Node.Js Web-Server that serves HTML files
## What to use for
You can use this web-server to test application and to deploy dynamic Web sites to host providers.
## Requirements
  - Node and NPM installed on machine. To see if you have it installed, use the code under and you should see something like this:
  ```sh
$ node -v
v8.11.3
$ npm -v
6.2.0
  ```
  
## Using that web-server
  - **Install Dependencies** - You need to run npm install to use the required librarys
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
  - **Paste a /public folder into root folder** -  Now that the dependencies were installed you're going to need to paste your html files for the web-server to serve!
  
  ``The **/public** folder should have and **index.html** file``
  
  - **Serving application** - To serve the application, simply go to the root folder and run the code:
  ```sh
  $ npm run start
  or
  $ node server.js
  ```
  - **And That`s it!** - The webserver will host the application on port 3000, you can change it if you want it on the server.js file
